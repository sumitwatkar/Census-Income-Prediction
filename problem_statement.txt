- In this notebook, we are going to predict whether a person's income is above 50k or below 50k using various features like age, education, and occupation.

- The Adult census income dataset contains about 32561 rows and 15 features which can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income

- The dataset contains the labels which we have to predict and the labels are discrete and binary. So this is a Supervised Classification type.
